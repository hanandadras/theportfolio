              <span className="Title">About me:</span> <br/>
              I am a candidate at the UC Davis full stack web development graduating in March 2022.
              I have a few years experience in SEO. I worked for a Forex brokerage company with focus on international buyers and helped the company reach clients in the US, Europe and the Mena region. I also worked as an investment banker analyst in the private equity, venture capital and buyout areas.
              I like reading, travelling and enjoy cooking different cuisines.
